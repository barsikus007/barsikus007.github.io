## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun i`, start a development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## Building

Solid apps are built with _presets_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `bun run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `bun start`. To use a different preset, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `app.config.js`.

## This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://solid-cli.netlify.app)
